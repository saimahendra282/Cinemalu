I vibe-coded this repo 
What it does is simple:

Fetches movie metadata from the TMDB API

Fetches streaming links from VidLink

Combines both to deliver instant movie streaming

That’s it — browse, click, watch.

# How It Works

TMDB → movie details (title, poster, description, etc.)

VidLink → video streaming embed

No accounts, no storage, just watch and leave

# Work in Progress

I’m currently exploring:

Multi-audio support

Telugu / regional movie sources

Better streaming providers and fallbacks

This project will be updated again and again as new sources are added.
